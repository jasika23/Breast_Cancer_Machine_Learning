# Breast_Cancer_Machine_Learning
This repository contains my analysis of existing patients of Breast Cancer and using Machine learning techniques to train and test my data. I have also performed analysis to see what contributes the most to breast cancer's positive biopsy results amongst the factors 

The initial csv file is named group21_csv. It includes all the information about the pateints studied for this research and what were their lifestyles and habits. This analyisis is done to understand what sort of lifestyle choices can contribute to cervical cancer in women. 

The entire analysis is done in JupyterLab and is divided in two phases:

Phase 1: which includes data cleaning pre- processing. We then visualise the factors contributing to the cancer and perform analysis.
phase 2: This is an in depth analysis covering all the machibe learning techniques involving feature selection and one hot encoding. 
For my Machine learning model, I have used KNN, Naive Bayes , Decision Trees and Neural Network to see which onw will be most beneficial in predicting the cancer in patients given thier lifestyles.
